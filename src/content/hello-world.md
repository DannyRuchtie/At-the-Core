Wow I really crononberg'd up the whole place huh Morty, just a bunch a cronenbergs walkin around. Snuffles was my slave name. You can call me Snowball, because my fur is pretty and white. If I've learned one thing, it's that before you get anywhere in life, you gotta stop listening to yourself. Cool. Just stay in the driveway; the kill-bots are live, and I took you off the whitelist.

Nothing you do matters, your existence is a lie! Aw, geez. Who cares, Morty? Global acts of terrorism happen every day. Uh, here's something that's never happened beforeâ€”I'm a pickle! I'm Pickle Ri-i-i-ick! Rick, is this a Saw thing? Are you seriously Sawing the Vindicators?

God, Grandpa, you're such a dick. Yes. He's a getaway driver with Asperger's and my butthole is a demolitions expert. Well let me check my list of powers and weaknesses: ability to do anything, but only whenever I want. Yeah, that sounds like a job for me. Don't be a baby! You avoid getting shot in real life all the time, Morty! Just do the same thing here and we'll be fine!
