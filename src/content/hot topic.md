Return it? Are you insane? Did you hear nothing I said? Buy another one, Morty! Consume, Morty! Nobody's out there shopping with this fucking virus! Shadow Jacker, you haven't come out of your masturbation cave in eons! My name is Slip- Slippery Stair. I'll take ya down there for 25 shmeckels! Jesus Christ! Did the boomy-booms blow up all your wordy-word books?

## Science
Sometimes science is a lot more art, than science. A lot of people don't get that. Puffy vagina. Don't be trippin dog we got you. I'd like to order one large phone with extra phones please. cell phone, no no no rotary... and payphone on half.

## Jacker
Shadow Jacker, you haven't come out of your masturbation cave in eons! My sister died in the spaghetti. Because I don't respect therapy; because I'm a scientist; because I invent, transform, create, and destroy for a living, and when I don't like something about the world, I change it. And I don't think going to a rented office in a strip mall to listen to some agent of averageness explain which words mean which feelings has ever helped anyone do anything. I think it's helped a lot of people get comfortable and stop panicking, which is a state of mind we value in the animals we eat, but not something I want for myself. I'm not a cow, I'm a pickle... when I feel like it. Well, if it's God power that gets you going, light some candles and put on the Billy Ocean, 'cause Moses is home, and he's ready to burn some bush!

## Full Circle
The fucking amish bitch shot me! Aw, geez. Well let me check my list of powers and weaknesses: ability to do anything, but only whenever I want. Yeah, that sounds like a job for me. This is it, Morty! It's full circle from the pilot! Full circle! … Oh, I guess we, uh… I guess we both just had to take a shit.
